      <h1>Ad Blocking Technologies</h1>

	 <p> Ad blockers were born around 2002 as a response to intrusive advertising and to sites that used malware or spyware.</p>
	 
	<p> Ad blockers work in many different ways.</p>
	  
	  <p>One method is simply to block (or prevent auto-play of) video and audio files. This can be done in most browsers easily. This method is refined by numerous browser extensions.</p>
	  
	  <p>The more advanced ad blocking filter software allow better control of advertisements through advanced features, such as blacklists and whitelists filters. Many modern antivirus software also include ad blocker functionality. </p>

      <h2>Popular Ad Blocking Technologies </h2>
	
	<p>Here is the list of the most popular technologies in 2019:</p>
	  
	 <dl>
	  	<dt>Browser Integration</dt>
			<dd>As of 2015, many web browsers block unsolicited pop-up ads automatically. Browser extensions, such as AdBlock, Adblock Plus, and uBlock Origin, provide regularly updated filter lists. Google released its built-in ad blocker for the Chrome/Chromium in February 2018, which blocks some ads by default.</dd>
		 
		 <dt>External Programs</dt>
		 
		 	<dd>A number of external software applications offer ad filtering as a primary or additional feature. A traditional solution is to customize an HTTP proxy (or web proxy) to filter content. These programs work by caching and filtering content before it is displayed in a user's browser. This provides an opportunity to remove not only ads but also content which may be offensive, inappropriate, or even malicious. </dd>
		 
		 <dt>Other popular methods include:</dt>
			 <dd>-Hosts file and DNS manipulation</dd>
			 <dd>-DNS filtering</dd>
			 <dd>-Recursive Local VPN</dd>
			 <dd>-Hardware devices</dd>
