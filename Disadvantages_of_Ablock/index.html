		<p style="font-size: 1.4em;">Does it feel like you're subjected to advertisements all day? Have you ever had a conversation about something and then start seeing advertisements for that item in your social media feed? A simple google search has ads. Some ads may interest you, while others may not, but there is a lot of discussion nowadays about advertisements and privacy. As more and more people become connected online, and the Internet of Things grows, the number of advertisements will grow as well.</p><br>

		<p style="font-size: 1.4em">Whether streaming videos, browsing social media, or just surfing the internet advertisements are everywhere.

Usually installed as a browser extension, ad blocking software filters certain media types and content.
